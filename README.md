# yt-playlist-to-clipboard
A simple python program that sends vids in a youtube playlist to your clipboard one by one.

Somet things to take note of:
- This will need **youtube-dl.exe** in the same path as itself.
- This will also reverse the order of playlist because it's mainly used for "Uploads from ____" playlists of channels. I will add a way to disable this in the future.
